pip3 uninstall awscli
```

## Purge
```
sudo apt-get --purge {package name}
```
example
```
sudo apt-get --purge awscli
```


what is the difference between purge and remove?
> apt-get remove (removes) the package called awscli but keep the configuration files.


>apt-get purge (removes) package and configuration files too

For example, delete a package named awscli including config files stored in /etc/ directory

## Zip and Unzip

### How to Zip
```
gzip {file name}
```
I want to zip a file named test.txt, run:
```
> gzip test.txt

> ls
test.txt.gz
```
### How to Unzip
```
gunzip {file name}
```
I want to unzip a file named test.txt, run:
```
> ls
text.txt.gz

> gunzip test.txt

>ls
test.txt
```
### Scenario:
    How do I zip all the .txt files in a current directory?

### run:
    gzip *.txt 

here,
>The * sign is a wildcard, which means “any number of any characters.” This command would work on any (and all) filenames with the extension .txt
